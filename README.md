# **Stopwatch Application Documentation**

This is a simple stopwatch application created using HTML, CSS, Tailwind
CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows the user to start, pause,
and reset the timer.

## **Usage**

To use the stopwatch application, simply open the index.html file in a
web browser. The application will display a stopwatch box with three
buttons:

-   Start - Click this button to start the timer.

-   Pause - Click this button to pause the timer.

-   Reset - Click this button to reset the timer to 00:00:00.

The timer will display the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

## **Implementation Details**

The stopwatch application was created using the following technologies:

-   HTML - Used to create the structure of the application.

-   CSS - Used to style the application.

-   Tailwind CSS - Used to quickly create custom styles.

-   JavaScript - Used to add functionality to the application.

The index.html file contains the HTML structure of the application,
which includes a container with a title and a stopwatch box that
contains three buttons. The style tag in the HTML file contains the CSS
and Tailwind CSS styles for the application.

The JavaScript code for the application is located in the script tag in
the HTML file. The code defines four functions - displayTime,
startTimer, pauseTimer, and resetTimer - that control the functionality
of the stopwatch. The displayTime function updates the timer display
with the current elapsed time. The startTimer function starts the timer
when the Start button is clicked. The pauseTimer function pauses the
timer when the Pause button is clicked. The resetTimer function resets
the timer to 00:00:00 when the Reset button is clicked.

The JavaScript code also adds event listeners to the Start, Pause, and
Reset buttons, which call the corresponding functions when clicked.

## **Conclusion**

The stopwatch application is a simple example of how HTML, CSS, Tailwind
CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create a functional and interactive
web application. The application can be easily modified and extended to
add additional features and functionality.
